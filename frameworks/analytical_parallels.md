## Core Principle

**"This is the X of Y" -- if a new idea matches an established thesis across 5+ dimensions, the new idea inherits the conviction framework.**

Analytical parallels are structured analogies. When a new investment idea is unfamiliar, under-followed, or lacks analyst coverage, conviction is hard to build from first principles alone. By constructing a rigorous, point-by-point analogy to an established thesis where conviction already exists, the new idea can inherit the analytical framework, risk assessment, and conviction level of the known thesis.

**Uncomfortable truth:** Most analysts' "this reminds me of X" comparisons are intellectually lazy -- they cherry-pick flattering dimensions and ignore structural differences. Rigorous parallels require the courage to score honestly, list non-matching dimensions, and accept when the parallel is weak. If you can't find a dimension that scores below 4, you're forcing the match.

This is not lazy pattern matching. It is disciplined: minimum 5 dimensions, scored match strength, explicit limitations, and independent validation required.

## The MP Materials / Cleveland-Cliffs Parallel (Exemplar)

This canonical example demonstrates the method. The established thesis (MP Materials as sole domestic rare earth producer) provides a conviction framework that maps to a new thesis (Cleveland-Cliffs/GOES steel).

| Dimension | MP Materials (Established Thesis) | CLF / GOES Steel (New Thesis) | Match Strength (1-5) |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Sole domestic producer** | Only US rare earth mine and processing facility | Only US producer of grain-oriented electrical steel (GOES) | 5 |
| **National security asset** | Rare earths critical for defense (F-35, missiles, EVs) | GOES critical for transformers, which are critical for grid | 5 |
| **Binary revenue inflection** | Revenue dependent on processing capacity coming online | Revenue dependent on transformer demand inflection from AI/grid buildout | 4 |
| **Currently unprofitable / missed by screens** | Traded at a loss during ramp phase; screened out by value/quality screens | CLF trades at depressed earnings; value screens see "declining steel company" | 4 |
| **Government policy support** | Defense Production Act invocations, DOE grants | Grid modernization policy, CHIPS Act adjacency, DOE transformer initiatives | 4 |
| **Controversial / misunderstood** | Bears said "China will flood the market"; bulls said "strategic asset" | Bears say "commodity steel, structural decline"; bulls say "sole-source critical material" | 4 |

**Average Match Strength:** 4.3 -- Strong Parallel

**Inherited Conviction:** MP Materials was a successful thesis based on sole-source + national security + policy support. If CLF/GOES matches across these dimensions, the conviction framework transfers: this is a potential sole-source strategic asset trading at a commodity discount.

**Critical Caveat:** The parallel provides a conviction scaffold, not proof. The GOES thesis must still be validated independently on its own merits (demand model, supply analysis, management assessment).

## Parallel Construction Template

Use this template to build an analytical parallel between an established thesis and a new thesis.

```
### Analytical Parallel: [ESTABLISHED TICKER] -> [NEW TICKER]
Date: [DATE]
Analyst: [AGENT]

Established Thesis: [Brief description of the known, high-conviction thesis]
New Thesis: [Brief description of the new idea being evaluated]

| Dimension | Established Thesis [TICKER] | New Thesis [TICKER] | Match Strength (1-5) |
|-----------|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| [Dimension 1] | [Evidence] | [Evidence] | |
| [Dimension 2] | [Evidence] | [Evidence] | |
| [Dimension 3] | [Evidence] | [Evidence] | |
| [Dimension 4] | [Evidence] | [Evidence] | |
| [Dimension 5] | [Evidence] | [Evidence] | |
| [Dimension 6 (optional)] | [Evidence] | [Evidence] | |
| [Dimension 7 (optional)] | [Evidence] | [Evidence] | |

Average Match Strength: [Calculated average]
Classification: [Strong / Partial / Weak -- see scoring below]

Inherited Conviction Elements:
- [What aspects of conviction transfer from the established thesis]

Dimensions That Do NOT Match:
- [Explicitly list dimensions where the parallel breaks down]

Independent Validation Required:
- [List the specific validations needed beyond the parallel]
```

### Minimum Requirements

- **Minimum 5 dimensions** required for a valid parallel
- Every dimension must have **evidence for both sides** (not just the new thesis)
- At least **one dimension must be scored below 4** (no perfect parallels exist; if all 5s, you're forcing the match)
- **Non-matching dimensions must be explicitly listed** -- omitting them is intellectual dishonesty

## Scoring

### Match Strength Scale

| Score | Meaning | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 5 | **Near-identical** | The dimension matches almost exactly; the parallel is direct and obvious |
| 4 | **Strong match** | The dimension matches in substance with minor differences in degree or context |
| 3 | **Moderate match** | The dimension matches in concept but differs in important ways |
| 2 | **Weak match** | The dimension has surface similarity but meaningful structural differences |
| 1 | **No match** | The dimension does not match; this is a point of divergence |

### Composite Score Interpretation

| Average Score | Classification | Implication |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| 4.0 - 5.0 | **Strong Parallel** | High conviction transfer. New thesis inherits the established framework. Proceed with confidence (subject to independent validation). |
| 3.5 - 3.9 | **Solid Parallel** | Meaningful conviction transfer. New thesis has significant overlap but notable differences. Proceed with moderate confidence. |
| 2.5 - 3.4 | **Partial Parallel** | Limited conviction transfer. The analogy illuminates but does not prove. Use as one input among many. |
| 1.0 - 2.4 | **Weak Parallel** | Minimal conviction transfer. The analogy is more misleading than helpful. Do not use as basis for conviction. |

## Dimension Selection Guide

Choosing the right dimensions is critical. Use dimensions that are structurally meaningful, not superficial.

### Strong Dimensions (High Signal)

| Dimension | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|
| Market structure (sole source, oligopoly) | Directly determines pricing power and competitive dynamics |
| Strategic / national security relevance | Determines policy support probability and demand floor |
| Revenue inflection timing | Determines whether the opportunity is in early or late innings |
| Misunderstanding by standard screens | Determines whether mispricing exists and is exploitable |
| Supply constraint mechanism | Determines durability of the opportunity |
| Customer lock-in / switching costs | Determines revenue sustainability |

### Weak Dimensions (Low Signal -- Avoid)

| Dimension | Why It's Weak |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Both are in the same sector" | Sector membership is not a thesis |
| "Both stocks are down this year" | Price action is not a structural parallel |
| "Both have the same market cap" | Size is coincidental, not causal |
| "Management said similar things" | Words are cheap; match on actions and structure |
| "Both are in the news" | Media attention is noise, not signal |

## False Parallel Warning Signs

Before accepting a parallel, check for these failure modes:

| Warning Sign | Description | Mitigation |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **Forced matching** | Stretching to make dimensions fit when they don't naturally align | Score honestly; if >2 dimensions are below 3, the parallel is weak |
| **Ignoring contradicting dimensions** | Highlighting matches while omitting structural differences | Require explicit listing of non-matching dimensions |
| **Different macro context** | The established thesis operated in a different macro environment | Assess whether macro context is a key driver; if so, note the difference |
| **Survivorship bias** | Choosing an established thesis that worked, ignoring similar theses that failed | Identify the closest failed analog and explain why the new thesis avoids that failure mode |
| **Correlation vs. causation** | Dimensions match coincidentally, not because of shared structural drivers | Ask: "Is there a causal mechanism linking these dimensions, or are they independent coincidences?" |
| **Outcome anchoring** | Knowing the established thesis was profitable biases match assessment upward | Score each dimension before calculating the composite; don't anchor to the desired outcome |

## Using Parallels in the IST Pipeline

### Conviction Elevation

A strong parallel (score >= 3.5) can elevate a candidate's tier classification:

| Without Parallel | With Strong Parallel | Rationale |
|------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Tier 3 (watch) | Tier 2 (active screening) | Parallel provides conviction scaffold sufficient for deeper analysis |
| Tier 2 (screening) | Tier 1 candidate (pending independent validation) | Parallel + independent validation = high conviction |
| Tier 1 (already) | Tier 1 with increased position size confidence | Parallel reinforces existing thesis |

### Conviction Limitations

A parallel **cannot**:
- Replace independent demand modeling (use `demand_modeling.md`)
- Override a failed stress test (use `null_hypothesis.md`)
- Substitute for quantitative analysis
- Be the sole basis for a Tier 1 classification

A parallel **can**:
- Provide initial conviction to justify deeper analysis
- Identify which dimensions to validate first
- Frame the thesis in terms the team understands
- Highlight non-consensus elements borrowed from the established thesis

---

## Multiple Parallels

When a new thesis matches multiple established theses, each parallel is constructed independently and the results are compared:

```
### Multi-Parallel Assessment: [NEW TICKER]

| Parallel | Established Thesis | Average Match | Classification |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Parallel A | [TICKER A] | [Score] | [Strong/Partial/Weak] |
| Parallel B | [TICKER B] | [Score] | [Strong/Partial/Weak] |
| Parallel C | [TICKER C] | [Score] | [Strong/Partial/Weak] |

Strongest Parallel: [Which one and why]
Contradictions Between Parallels: [Where do they disagree?]
Net Conviction: [Higher/Lower than single parallel]
```

If multiple parallels converge on the same conclusion through different dimensions, conviction increases. If they contradict, the new thesis needs more independent work.

## Integration

- **Primary Application:** Used in `06_TIER_CLASSIFICATION.md` to elevate conviction for unfamiliar ideas
- **Referenced In:** `.ist/OPTIMIST_REVIEW.md` (optimist uses parallels to build bull case)
- **Cross-Reference:** `scarcity_abundance.md` (scarcity dimensions are strong parallel candidates), `scar_tissue_thesis.md` (scar tissue is a reusable parallel dimension)
- **Challenge Required:** @Screen_Pessimist must challenge every parallel in `.ist/PESSIMIST_REVIEW.md` -- specifically testing for false parallel warning signs

*Parallels build conviction on the unfamiliar by mapping it to the familiar. But maps are not territory. Validate independently.*
