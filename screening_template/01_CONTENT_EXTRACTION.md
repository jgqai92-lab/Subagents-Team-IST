# Content Extraction

<!-- This file is created/managed by @Content_Analyst -->
<!-- Purpose: Extract investable claims from user-provided content with source tags -->
<!-- Phase: Created during Phase 1 -->

## Extraction Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total claims extracted | [N] |
| Claims with quantitative anchors | [N] |
| Claims with temporal markers | [N] |
| Named bottlenecks identified | [N] |
| Sources processed | [N] |

## Investable Claims

### Claim 1: [Short title]

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Claim** | [Exact claim with context] |
| **Source** | [SOURCE: Speaker, timestamp/page, exact quote] |
| **Quantitative Anchor** | [Number(s) cited -- if none, mark [GAP]] |
| **Temporal Marker** | [Time horizon -- if none, mark [GAP]] |
| **Named Bottleneck** | [Specific constraint -- if none, mark [GAP]] |
| **Causal Logic** | [Why is this constrained? Physical limits, institutional, regulatory?] |
| **Investability** | [High/Medium/Low -- is this actionable?] |
| **Confidence** | [High/Medium/Low -- how explicitly stated?] |

### Claim 2: [Short title]
[Same structure as Claim 1]

### Claim N: [Short title]
[Repeat for all extracted claims]

## Claims Without Quantitative Backing

| # | Claim | Source | Why Deprioritized | Could Be Rescued? |
|---|-------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | [claim] | [source] | [No numbers/vague] | [Yes if X data found / No] |

## Source Bias Summary

| Source | Bias Direction | Key Incentive | Impact on Claims | Mitigation |
|--------|---------------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| [Source 1] | [Direction] | [Incentive] | [Which claims affected] | [Approach] |

## Bottleneck Inventory

| # | Bottleneck Name | Type | Source Claims | Temporal Phase | Quantified? |
|---|----------------|------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | [Name] | [Physical/Institutional/Regulatory] | [Claim #s] | [Phase estimate] | [Yes/No] |

## Anti-Hallucination Checklist

- [ ] Every claim has a [SOURCE] tag with specific reference
- [ ] Quantitative anchors verified as stated (not inferred)
- [ ] Temporal markers are from source (not assumed)
- [ ] Source bias assessed for all inputs (INV-8)
- [ ] No fabricated data -- all gaps marked [GAP]
