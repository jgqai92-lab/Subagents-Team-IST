*[Date] | For Informational Purposes Only*

---

## I. Executive Summary

[2-3 paragraph narrative: core insight from the source content, why it matters for investors,
and what the screening process found. This should stand alone as a thesis statement.]

### Consolidated Screen: [N] Equities Across [N] Pillars

[Prose explaining tier methodology: what defines Tier 1 (high conviction, unloved/mispriced),
Tier 2 (on thesis but fully valued), and Tier 3 (speculative/binary).]

| Ticker | Company | Price | 52-Wk Range | Fwd P/E | vs. High | Pillar | Tier |
|--------|---------|-------|-------------|---------|----------|--------|------|
| [All equities from master screen, ordered by tier then pillar] |

---

## II. Pillar-by-Pillar Analysis

[Each major bottleneck or cluster of related bottlenecks from 02_BOTTLENECK_MAP.md becomes
a "pillar." Group equities under their thematic pillar, not alphabetically or by tier.]

### Pillar [N]: [Pillar Name / Bottleneck Theme]

[Narrative thesis: what is constrained and why. Weave in quantitative evidence from
02_BOTTLENECK_MAP and 03_DEMAND_MODELS. Use actual numbers, formulas, multipliers.
Write analytical prose, not bullet points or attribute/value tables.]

> **[KEY FORMULA / INSIGHT NAME]**
>
> [Quantitative formula or insight from demand models, formatted as blockquote.
> Include TAM/market sizing calculation if applicable. All numbers must trace
> back to sourced claims in templates 00-04.]

> **SKEPTIC'S STRESS TEST: [Specific Claim Being Tested]**
>
> [Inline stress test from 11_STRESS_TESTS. What's the null hypothesis?
> What would break this thesis? What's the base rate? Keep concise.
> At least one per pillar is required.]

**Investable Names: [Pillar] Pillar**

**[TICKER] ([Company Name]) | ~$[Price] | 52-wk: $[Low]-$[High] | Fwd P/E: ~[X]x | TIER [N]**

[Narrative paragraph: Why this company? What's the moat? What's the catalyst?
What's the valuation case? 3-5 sentences of analytical prose. Every name on the
screen must have a prose paragraph -- not just a table row.]

[Repeat for each equity in this pillar]

---

[Repeat Pillar sections for each major bottleneck theme]

---

## III. Second and Third-Order Effects

[Reframe effects map (template 07) as conditional scenarios. Connect all pillars
into a unified narrative if a recursive or self-reinforcing loop exists.]

> **[MASTER THESIS NAME]: The [Unifying Pattern]**
>
> [Narrative connecting all pillars into a recursive or self-reinforcing loop,
> if one exists. From 07_EFFECTS_MAP.]

### If [Thesis/Bottleneck 1] Remains the Binding Constraint

- **2nd Order:** [Effect + equity exposure if applicable]
- **3rd Order:** [Effect + equity exposure if applicable]

### If [Thesis/Bottleneck 2] Compounds

- **2nd Order:** [Effect]
- **3rd Order:** [Effect]

[Repeat for major theses from effects map]

---

## IV. [Optional: Civilizational / Big-Picture Framing]

[Only include this section if the source content warrants it. Long-term context,
structural shifts, multi-decade horizons. Mark speculative content clearly.
Delete this section entirely if not applicable.]

---

## V. Portfolio Construction Guidance

### Tier 1: Core Positions ([X-Y]% of allocation)

[Prose: which names, why they're highest conviction, what makes them "unloved" or mispriced.
From 06_TIER_CLASSIFICATION and post-dialectic adjustments.]

### Tier 2: Watchlist / Pullback Entry ([X-Y]%)

[Prose: on thesis but fully valued, what would make them actionable. Entry triggers.]

### Tier 3: Speculative ([X-Y]%)

[Prose: binary outcomes, position size discipline.]

### Key Upcoming Catalysts

| Date | Ticker | Event |
|------|--------|-------|
| [From 10_CATALYST_CALENDAR, simplified to most important catalysts only] |
