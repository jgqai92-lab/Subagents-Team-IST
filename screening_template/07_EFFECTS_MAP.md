# Effects Map

<!-- This file is created/managed by @Effects_Analyst -->
<!-- Purpose: Map 2nd and 3rd order downstream effects for all primary theses -->
<!-- Phase: Created during Phase 3 -->
<!-- Framework: multi_order_effects.md -->

## Effects Summary

| Primary Thesis | 1st Order (Consensus) | 2nd Order (Emerging) | 3rd Order (Non-Consensus) |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| [Thesis 1] | [Effect] | [Effect] | [Effect] |
| [Thesis 2] | [Effect] | [Effect] | [Effect] |

## Detailed Effects Analysis

### Thesis 1: [Primary Thesis Statement]

**Source:** [From 01_CONTENT_EXTRACTION.md, Claim #X]

#### 1st Order Effects (Consensus -- likely priced)

| Effect | Equity Exposure | Market Awareness | Priced In? |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| [Direct effect] | [TICKER(s)] | High | [Likely yes] |

#### 2nd Order Effects (Emerging -- pockets of mispricing)

| Effect | Transmission Mechanism | Equity Exposure | Market Awareness | Evidence |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| [Downstream effect] | [How 1st order causes this] | [TICKER(s)] | [Medium/Low] | [Source] |

#### 3rd Order Effects (Non-Consensus -- under-followed)

| Effect | Transmission Mechanism | Equity Exposure | Market Awareness | Evidence | Confidence |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|---------|------------|
| [Further downstream] | [How 2nd order causes this] | [TICKER(s)] | [Low/Very Low] | [Source] | [High/Med/Low] |

#### Causal Chain Validation

| Link | Causal? | Evidence | Alternative Explanation |
|------|---------|---------|----------------------|
| 1st -> 2nd | [Yes/Partial/No] | [Evidence] | [Alternative] |
| 2nd -> 3rd | [Yes/Partial/No] | [Evidence] | [Alternative] |

### Thesis 2: [Primary Thesis Statement]
[Same structure]

## New Equity Candidates from Effects Analysis

| Ticker | Company | Discovered via | Order | Thesis | Add to 05? |
|--------|---------|---------------|-------|--------|-----------|
| [TICKER] | [Name] | [Which effect chain] | [2nd/3rd] | [Brief thesis] | [Yes/No] |

## Risk Escalation: Multi-Order Uncertainty

| Effect Order | Position Size Guidance | Rationale |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------|
| 1st order | Standard (per tier) | Consensus, well-understood |
| 2nd order | 75% of standard | Emerging, some uncertainty |
| 3rd order | 50% of standard | Non-consensus, high uncertainty |

## Invariant Compliance

- [ ] INV-7: Multi-order effects mapped for every primary thesis
- [ ] INV-1: New candidates from effects analysis have bottleneck exposure
