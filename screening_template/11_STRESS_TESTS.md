# Stress Tests

<!-- This file is created/managed by @Screen_Synthesizer -->
<!-- Purpose: Refined stress tests incorporating Pessimist review findings -->
<!-- Phase: Created during Phase 5, refined from .ist/PESSIMIST_REVIEW.md -->
<!-- Framework: null_hypothesis.md -->

## Stress Test Summary

| # | Test Name | Scope | Severity if Wrong | Mitigable? |
|---|----------|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1 | [Test name] | [Thesis-level / Name-level / Framework-level] | [HIGH/MED/LOW] | [Yes/Partial/No] |

## Framework-Level Stress Tests

### Test 1: [What if the entire framework is wrong?]

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Null Hypothesis** | [What must be true for the framework to fail?] |
| **Probability** | [Low/Medium/High] |
| **Evidence Against** | [What would we see if this were happening?] |
| **Historical Base Rate** | [How often have similar predictions been wrong?] |
| **Portfolio Impact** | [What happens to the screen if this is wrong?] |
| **Mitigation** | [Position sizing, diversification, stop-losses] |

### Test 2: [Efficiency gains reduce demand (DeepSeek-type risk)]
[Same structure]

### Test 3: [Timeline risk -- predictions are early/late]
[Same structure]

### Test 4: [Source bias -- incentive-driven narrative]
[Same structure]

## Name-Level Stress Tests

### [TICKER]: Stress Test Results

| Test | Question | Result | Survived? |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | What must be true? | [Answer] | [Y/N] |
| 2 | What breaks the thesis? | [Answer] | [Y/N] |
| 3 | Base rate for accuracy? | [Answer] | [Y/N] |
| 4 | Selection bias? | [Answer] | [Y/N] |
| 5 | Timeline risk? | [Answer] | [Y/N] |
| 6 | Efficiency gains? | [Answer] | [Y/N] |
| 7 | Coordination vs capacity? | [Answer] | [Y/N] |
| 8 | Capex deceleration? | [Answer] | [Y/N] |
| **Survival Score** | | **[X]/8** | |

### Stress Test -> Position Sizing

| Ticker | Survival Score | Recommended Allocation | Pessimist Adjustment |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| [TICKER] | [X]/8 | [X-Y]% | [Adjustment from Pessimist review] |

## Pessimist Integration

| Pessimist Finding | Severity | Addressed? | Resolution |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| [Finding from .ist/PESSIMIST_REVIEW.md] | [CRITICAL/HIGH/MED] | [Yes/Partial/No] | [How addressed] |

## Invariant Compliance

- [ ] Every Tier 1 name survived stress-testing (Gate 3 requirement)
- [ ] All Pessimist findings addressed
- [ ] Position sizing reflects survival scores
