## Classification Criteria

### Tier 1: High Conviction Unloved
| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Scarcity moat | Strong (score >= 4) |
| Valuation | Forward P/E < 20x OR >15% below highs |
| External validation | Multi-source confirmed |
| Moat verified | Against filings/data |
| Suggested allocation | 5-8% per name |

### Tier 2: Fully Valued Watchlist
| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Scarcity moat | Strong (score >= 4) |
| Valuation | Near ATH or forward P/E > 25x |
| Thesis | Correct but priced in |
| Action | Wait for pullback/earnings miss/FUD |
| Suggested allocation | 3-5% per name (on pullback) |

### Tier 3: Speculative
| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Thesis quality | Binary outcome / long-duration assumptions |
| Risk | Pre-revenue, pre-inflection, extreme volatility |
| Position limit | 1-3% maximum per name |

## Tier Assignment

| Ticker | Company | Tier | Scarcity Score | Fwd P/E | Dist from High | Multi-Source? | Moat Verified? | Rationale |
|--------|---------|------|---------------|---------|----------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| [TICKER] | [Name] | [1/2/3] | [Score] | [Xx] | -[X]% | [Y/N] | [Y/N] | [Brief] |

## Tier 1 Detail

### [TICKER]: Why Tier 1

| Factor | Assessment | Evidence |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Scarcity moat strength | [Score]/5 | [Evidence] |
| Valuation discount | [Metric] | [Data] |
| Multi-source validation | [Yes -- N sources] | [Sources] |
| Moat verification | [Verified against X] | [Filing/data ref] |
| Scar tissue discount? | [Yes/No] | [Evidence] |
| Analytical parallel? | [Yes -- "X of Y"] | [Reference] |

## Tier 2 Detail

### [TICKER]: Why Tier 2 (Not Tier 1)

| Factor | Assessment | What Would Change Tier? |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|
| Valuation | [Too expensive -- X metric] | [Pull back to $X / P/E of Xx] |
| Thesis priced in? | [Yes -- X evidence] | [New catalyst / earnings surprise] |

## Tier 3 Detail

### [TICKER]: Why Tier 3

| Factor | Assessment | Binary Risk |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Revenue status | [Pre-revenue/Early] | [If X happens -> Y; if not -> Z] |
| Timeline dependency | [Depends on X by Y] | [Probability assessment] |
| Position limit | [1-2% max] | [Risk of total loss] |

## Invariant Compliance

- [ ] INV-2: Every thesis has quantified moat
- [ ] INV-4: Every Tier 1 has valuation data
- [ ] Anti-Hallucination #6: Unverified moat = cannot be Tier 1
- [ ] Anti-Hallucination #7: Single-source = cannot be Tier 1
